  abstract        = { The t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding t-SNE is a
                  new dimension reduction and visualization technique for
                  high-dimensional data. t-SNE is rarely applied to human
                  genetic data, even though it is commonly used in other
                  data-intensive biological fields, such as single-cell
                  genomics. We explore the applicability of t-SNE to human
                  genetic data and make these observations: (i) similar to
                  previously used dimension reduction techniques such as
                  principal component analysis (PCA), t-SNE is able to separate
                  samples from different continents; (ii) unlike PCA, t-SNE is
                  more robust with respect to the presence of outliers; (iii)
                  t-SNE is able to display both continental and sub-continental
                  patterns in a single plot. We conclude that the ability for
                  t-SNE to reveal population stratification at different scales
                  could be useful for human genetic association studies. }
